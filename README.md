## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Greace

I'm originally from Indonesia but have been calling France and the UK home for the past 10 years. 
I studied ocean science and engineering, exploring everything related to the sea and sky, but now I'm diving into the world of data science. 
I love getting creative in the kitchen, and I'm all about the ocean, tech, and finding cool ways to solve problems. 
I speak Indonesian, English, and French, so Iâ€™m always up for a chat in any of those languages!
